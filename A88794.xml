            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>LEt it not be a trouble to you to read a few Lines from one unknown, but a much honorer of your Noble Spirit, and therefore deſirous to caſt in his dram of Advice among thoſe many and weighty Debates now before you.</p>
            <p>If I ſhould tell you of divers that had a power or capacity to contribute to, or reſtore Peace to theſe Nations, and have neglected the Opportunities, which they have ſince repented of, I am confident you would, even your ſelf, point out the men; namely, <hi>Eſſex, Fairfax, Waller, Maſſey, Browne, Rich, Cromwell,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> We look upon you at this inſtant as having the whole ſtrength of the Nation in your hands, but if you expect to hold it long, you will be miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deceived: Therefore I beſeech you make good uſe of this happy opportunity, and conſider how great you may make your ſelf, and how glorious you will be to poſterity, if you be a means of laying the Government on the ſhoulders of Him that ought to bear it, which will in an inſtant reſtore a happy Peace and Settlement to this diſtracted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Certainly, the greateſt honour, and a better eſtate than any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subject enjoys ſhall be your reward. But if you doubt how the Souldier and Perſons deeply concerned, that ſhall concur with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:168716:3"/>
you ſhall be ſecured and ſatisfied; See this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that to my knowledge hath been neer Three Moneths in this Town, and perhaps not yet come to your view. Are you not thereby convinced, or would you know under what Government the People would reſt moſt ſatisfied, either a Single Perſon, Council of State, Parliament, or Army? Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point ſuch a way as every man may without fear or danger give in his vote undiſcovered: To begin only with this Town; Let the Clerk of every Company, or Conſtable of every Ward, take a Ticket in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per from every man, and put it into a Box locked and ſealed, and you will find Nine parts of Ten encline to that Conſtitution we have lived under above theſe five hundred years: But if not, you will however by this courſe give great ſatisfaction to the People, in letting them have each an opportunity of declaring their minds, and thereby you will be rightly informed of their affections; which being weighted in the ballance of your judgement, you may with confidence and aſſurance ſteer on a ſtraight courſe to the Heaven of Happineſs and Safety.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> I conceive I have done my duty in declaring my mind, and have no more to ſay, but that you do as God ſhall put in your heart, and then go and proſper.</p>

We acknowledge it is very difficult, if not impoſſible to pleaſe all, eſpecially where there are ſo many diviſions, and every man almoſt of a ſeveral mind and opinion: But as we have propoſed to our Self, ſo ſhall we endevour to give all reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Satisfaction to all our Subjects. And if the Actings of the Repreſentatives in a Free Parliament of their own choice can ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them, we ſhall not be wanting in ſummoning and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with them: But if that will not pleaſe them, nothing will.</p>
            <p>Now, if theſe condeſcentions of ours ſhall have ſo much free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of paſſage in <hi>England,</hi> as many a ſcurrilous and lying Pamphlet flye abroad without our control, we are confident that all of underſtanding, that are not wilfully blinded or not over-ſwayed with preſent ſelf-intereſt, thereby knowing our large Offers, muſt needs be fully convinced of the amplitude thereof, extending to all their grievances.</p>
            <p>However, if it ſhall be inſtanced wherein we are two ſhort, (for we are ready for the Good, and Peace of the Nation, to give large ſatisfaction, and ample aſſurance to our moſt invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Enemies;) We having yielded to all matters of moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, ſhall not ſtick at leſſer things.</p>
            <p>And if any that have been adherers and aſſiſting to our late royal Father and us, ſhall think we are herein to free and indulgent to ſuch, and ſo many open and profeſſed Enemies; and that we have made no proviſion for our Servants, and Friends; we deſire them all to conſider our own, and alſo their Conditions, and how things now ſtand in <hi>England;</hi> That neither we, nor them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, can otherwiſe (in any probability) better our ſelves, unleſs by a bloody and hazzardous War; which though we cannot doubt of the lawfulneſs on our part, and conſequently a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous ſucceſs, if we ſhall be neceſſitated thereto for the recovery of our-juſt right, yet we are aſſured that the God of peace will rather proſper a peaceable then violent and forceable entrance: And therefore we hope all thoſe our friends, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sujects, will reſt fully ſatisfied with what we ſhall do purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to theſe propoſitions, we being deſirous hereafter to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their ſufferings (though not comparable to ours) as God ſhall enable, and in all juſt and lawful ways.</p>
